          <h1>Paranoid</h1>
          <p class="author"><i>by Black Sabbath</i></p>
          <p class="text">Finished with my woman 'cause
              She couldn't help me with my mind
              People think I'm insane because
              I am frowning all the time</p>
          <p class="text">All day long I think of things
              But nothing seems to satisfy
              Think I'll lose my mind
              If I don't find something to pacify</p>
          <p class="text">Can you help me
              Occupy my brain?
              Oh yeah</p>
          <p class="text">I need someone to show me
              The things in life that I can't find
              I can't see the things that make
              True happiness, I must be blind</p>
          <p class="text">Make a joke and I will sigh
              And you will laugh and I will cry
              Happiness I cannot feel
              And love to me is so unreal</p>
          <p class="text">And so as you hear these words
              Telling you now of my state
              I tell you to enjoy life
              I wish I could but it's too late</p>
